# Munarium Matrix

The **structured-evidence plane** of Munarium: a separately deployed Rust
service that registers formal data sources, materializes governed record
collections from them, executes verified query contracts against them, seals
the exact typed evidence an answer used into munarium-server, and produces
typed observations the server's ledger can reconcile against document-derived
claims.

The server stays the governance authority. Matrix never talks to a model
provider, never writes a server table, and never issues DDL or DML against a
customer source.


> **Status.** Munarium Matrix source version **1.0.0** includes the runtime
> and its four roles (`control`, `query`, `sync`, `reconcile`), the asset grammar, the refusal registry, the query compiler, materialization,
> reconcile, and the adapters for the databases most applications already run. It is validated by a
> conformance registry of scenarios that run on every push, and by a compose tier that exercises the
> HTTP, gRPC, MCP and admin planes against a real Munarium Server.
>
> **What is validated, and how.** Every adapter row in
> [docs/adapters/build-matrix.md](docs/adapters/build-matrix.md) states what that adapter can do,
> what it refuses, and what it has actually been run against — a claim there is backed by a
> conformance tier or it is marked as not run. The refusal registry
> ([docs/errors.md](docs/errors.md)) is kept honest by a test. `SCENARIOS.md` is generated, so it
> cannot drift from what exists.
>
> **What is not in this repository.** The adapters for analytics platforms — Databricks, BigQuery,
> Snowflake, Cube and dbt — are part of **Munarium Matrix Enterprise**, a separate proprietary
> product that builds on this one through the same public adapter interface. An asset naming one of
> them validates here and is refused at execution with `adapter_not_available`, naming what it
> needs. See [NOTICE](NOTICE) and [SUPPORT.md](../SUPPORT.md).
>
> **Known limitations at 1.0**, stated rather than implied: this release commits to the wire
> contract, the asset grammar, the refusal registry and the adapter interface under semantic
> versioning. It does not claim that every planned capability is finished. Each release publishes
> its open items in the release notes: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## About this repository

Matrix versions independently of Server, whose current published image is 1.2.1
(see [Server versions and verification](../server/CONTAINER.md#versions-and-verification)).
Build Matrix from this checkout using its Dockerfile or Rust workspace. The
Server's `iokaio/munarium` image contains Server and `mmctl`; it does not contain
Matrix or `mxctl`. Matrix's compatibility check distinguishes an exact version
match from a compatible major; see [the user guide](docs/user-guide.md).

## Quickstart

From the repository root, enter `matrix/`. The test scripts require PowerShell 7
and the Rust toolchain selected by [rust-toolchain.toml](rust-toolchain.toml).
Docker with Compose is needed for the database and service checks.

```powershell
cd matrix
# offline: unit tests, boundary checks, contract validation. No database.
./test.ps1

# + store and conformance against an owned disposable Postgres
./test.ps1 -Postgres

# the gates a reviewer expects
./test.ps1 -Gates
```

Run the service:

```powershell
docker compose up -d --build  # REST :8180, gRPC :50151, ops :9190
$env:MUNARIUM_MATRIX_TOKEN = 'mxdev'
cargo run -p munarium-matrix-cli -- version
cargo run -p munarium-matrix-cli -- validate -f fixtures/assets/valid/datasource.crm.yaml
cargo run -p munarium-matrix-cli -- apply -f fixtures/assets/valid/datasource.crm.yaml
cargo run -p munarium-matrix-cli -- list datasources
```

These are development credentials and ports. `cargo run` executes `mxctl` from
source; building the container does not install that command on your host.
Contracts and mappings must be applied before verification or reconciliation.
See [the user guide](docs/user-guide.md) for the full asset workflow.

To exercise evidence sealing, also start a Server and configure Matrix's peer.
From the same `matrix/` directory:

```powershell
$env:MUNARIUM_SERVER_IMAGE = 'iokaio/munarium:1.1.1'
$env:MUNARIUM_MATRIX_COMPOSE_SERVER_URL = 'http://munarium-server:8080'
docker compose --profile server up -d --build
```

The base stack alone can manage assets; operations that need the Server to seal
evidence fail without that peer. The optional Server publishes port 18080.
This example retains its explicit 1.1.1 pin; updating the current-release field
above does not qualify this example against another Server image.

## The five ideas worth knowing

**1. Two hashes, never conflated.** `logical_result_hash` answers "is this the
same answer?"; `artifact_hash` answers "are these the same bytes?". A CSV and a
Parquet serialization of one result share the first and differ in the second.
`canon@1` (`contract/canonicalization.schema.json`, implemented in
`munarium-matrix-core/src/canon.rs`) is the normative rule, and a test asserts
the code and the schema agree.

**2. A result that cannot name its rows cannot be sealed.** A contract declares
key columns or a total `orderBy`. Under keys the result hashes as a multiset, so
row order is irrelevant; under position it hashes as a sequence and needs a
total ordering. Declaring neither is a refusal, at apply time.

**3. Refuse before degrade.** Every failure is a typed [`Refusal`] with a
closed `class` the server switches on and an open `code` an operator reads.
There is no "best effort" path: a truncated result is marked truncated and
cannot back a completeness claim; an ambiguous identity files a finding and
merges nothing; a schema change refuses until a human records a decision id.

**4. String concatenation is not an implementation.** A contract's SQL is
parsed, walked against an allowlist of declared tables, columns and
deterministic functions, and rewritten to positional placeholders. `SELECT *`,
subqueries, `now()`, and any non-`SELECT` statement are refused. A denied
column is refused in *every* clause, not just the projection.

**5. Evidence is regulated data.** Every artifact carries an authorization
equivalence class, and a session resolving a citation must **dominate** it —
at least the access level, and every compartment. Domination is a conjunction,
tested in both directions.

## The boundary

`matrix/` never depends on a `server/` crate and `server/` never depends on a
`matrix/` crate. The only shared thing is `contract/`, vendored into
`server/contract/matrix/` and drift-checked on both sides.

This is enforced, not asked for: `test.ps1` and CI both run a `cargo tree` grep
that fails if any server crate appears in the graph — which also catches "just
use the official Rust client", since that client path-depends on server crates.

`munarium-matrix-core` additionally depends on no runtime at all: no `sqlx`, no
`reqwest`, no `axum`, no `tokio`. That is what lets the evidence-identity rules
be tested exhaustively in milliseconds.

## Testing

Local profiles emit the same source-bound validation receipts as Server. Exit 0
means every selected requirement passed; 1 means failure; 3 means required
coverage was unavailable or the source changed. `-ReceiptPath` selects the output;
otherwise it is under `server/scratch/validation/<run-id>/receipt.json`.
Ignored and early-return scenarios never establish stateful coverage. The shared
[receipt contract](../server/docs/guides/validation.md#outcomes-and-receipts)
and its independent validator apply to Matrix too.

| Tier | Where | Cost | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| offline | `./test.ps1` | $0 | every change |
| PostgreSQL | `./test.ps1 -Postgres` | $0 | database changes |
| HTTP/gRPC/admin/SQL Server | `./test.ps1 -BlackBox` | $0 for local fixtures | integration changes, and independently in CI |

`-Postgres` creates a UUID-named container from the pinned, already-loaded image,
copies only tracked fixture SQL, publishes an ephemeral loopback port, and removes
only its recorded container and anonymous volume. It never reuses or deletes a
developer's Compose database. The default workspace tier clears test environment
variables for its children and restores the caller's values afterward.

`-BlackBox` uses an explicitly prepared disposable stack. Set
`MUNARIUM_MATRIX_TEST_DATABASE_URL`, `_URL`, `_TOKEN`, `_MGMT_TOKEN`, `_GRPC`,
and `_SQLSERVER` (each with the `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_TEST` prefix). The database must
contain the tracked `fixtures/t0/sql` schema and CDC fixtures; Matrix needs a
Server peer for sealing. The runner does not provision or clean up that caller-owned
stack. Missing configuration yields an incomplete receipt; a configured broken
service fails. This replaces automatic mutation of fixed-name Compose resources.
Existing CI provisions its own stack and retains its automatic test gates.

`-MySql` explicitly selects the MySQL tier and requires
`MUNARIUM_MATRIX_TEST_MYSQL`; an open local port no longer silently selects it.
`-Browser` requires the URL and both tokens above, with Node/Playwright and Chromium
installed ahead of time. It does not download dependencies. `-All` selects gates,
PostgreSQL, black-box and MySQL; browser remains an explicit switch.
Browser screenshots stay in the receipt directory. The optional measurement
campaign is explicitly `not_requested`; run its separately frozen harness when
its workload and environment are ready.
Offline adapter controls: `py -m unittest discover -s tools -p test_validation.py`.
Live analytics tiers belong to Munarium Matrix Enterprise.

## Environment

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_ROLE` | `control` \| `query` \| `sync` \| `reconcile` \| `all` |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_HTTP_ADDR` / `_OPS_ADDR` | listeners; default `0.0.0.0:8180` / `0.0.0.0:9190` |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_GRPC_ADDR` | query-role listener; default `0.0.0.0:50151`; `disabled` turns it off |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_DATABASE_URL` | schema `matrix`, role `matrix_owner` |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_AUTH_MODE` | `static` (default) \| `disabled` |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_STATIC_TOKENS` | `token:tenant:role,...` where role is `rw` \| `ro` \| `mgmt` |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_SERVER_URL` | munarium-server base URL |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_SERVER_TOKEN_REF` | reference to the server token; resolved at call time |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_TARGET_SERVER_VERSION` | lockstep target; a **major** mismatch refuses to start |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_SECRET_<NAME>` | a `credentialRef` resolves here (also `env:` / `file:`) |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | per-role ceiling |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_EGRESS_DEFAULT_DENY` | default `true` |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_LOG` / `_LOG_FORMAT` | filter; `plain` \| `json` |

Roles gate the surface **structurally**: a `sync` container answers 404 on the
registry because it does not mount those routes at all.

## Ports

REST 8180, gRPC 50151, ops 9190 — no clash with the server's 8080/50051/9090 on one
laptop. The compose Postgres is on 5434 for the same reason.
