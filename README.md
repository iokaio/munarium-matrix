# Munarium Matrix

The **structured-evidence plane** of Munarium: a separately deployed Rust
service that registers formal data sources, materializes governed record
collections from them, executes verified query contracts against them, seals
the exact typed evidence an answer used into munarium-server, and produces
typed observations the server's ledger can reconcile against document-derived
claims.

The server stays the governance authority. Matrix never talks to a model
provider, never writes a server table, and never issues DDL or DML against a
customer source.


> **Status.** Munarium Matrix 1.0 is the structured-evidence plane in production form: the runtime
> and its three roles, the asset grammar, the refusal registry, the query compiler, materialization,
> reconcile, and the adapters for the databases most applications already run. It is validated by a
> conformance registry of scenarios that run on every push, and by a compose tier that exercises the
> HTTP, gRPC, MCP and admin planes against a real Munarium Server.
>
> **What is validated, and how.** Every adapter row in
> [docs/adapters/build-matrix.md](docs/adapters/build-matrix.md) states what that adapter can do,
> what it refuses, and what it has actually been run against — a claim there is backed by a
> conformance tier or it is marked as not run. The refusal registry
> ([docs/errors.md](docs/errors.md)) is kept honest by a test. `SCENARIOS.md` is generated, so it
> cannot drift from what exists.
>
> **What is not in this repository.** The adapters for analytics platforms — Databricks, BigQuery,
> Snowflake, Cube and dbt — are part of **Munarium Matrix Enterprise**, a separate proprietary
> product that builds on this one through the same public adapter interface. An asset naming one of
> them validates here and is refused at execution with `adapter_not_available`, naming what it
> needs. See [NOTICE](NOTICE) and [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md).
>
> **Known limitations at 1.0**, stated rather than implied: this release commits to the wire
> contract, the asset grammar, the refusal registry and the adapter interface under semantic
> versioning. It does not claim that every planned capability is finished. Each release publishes
> its open items in the release notes.

## About this repository

Munarium Matrix begins here, at version 1.0.0. Its design was worked out over an extended period of
private research and development — experiments, measurements, superseded designs, and the
operational records of the environments they ran in — and that history is deliberately not carried
into this repository.

It is omitted because it documents how the design was reached rather than how the software behaves,
and it would give an evaluator, an operator or a contributor nothing they need. What that work
produced is here in full: the implementation, its conformance suite, its API documentation and its
deployment assets. The conformance scenarios are the executable specification, and they are the
record worth reading.

## Quickstart

```powershell
# offline: unit tests, boundary checks, contract validation. No database.
./test.ps1

# + store and conformance against a compose Postgres
docker compose up -d postgres
./test.ps1 -Postgres

# the gates a reviewer expects
./test.ps1 -Gates
```

Run the service:

```powershell
docker compose up            # matrix on :8180, ops on :9190
mxctl version
mxctl validate -f fixtures/assets/valid/datasource.crm.yaml
mxctl apply    -f fixtures/assets/valid/datasource.crm.yaml
mxctl list datasources
mxctl sync crm                 # enqueue a sync, one job per authorization class
mxctl verify open-pipeline-by-region   # exit 3 if a verified question moved
mxctl mappings status captable-holdings          # promotion state + gate numbers
mxctl mappings promote captable-holdings --decision CHG-42   # gates checked server-side
mxctl mappings rollback captable-holdings --decision CHG-43  # supersede, never rewrite
```

## The five ideas worth knowing

**1. Two hashes, never conflated.** `logical_result_hash` answers "is this the
same answer?"; `artifact_hash` answers "are these the same bytes?". A CSV and a
Parquet serialization of one result share the first and differ in the second.
`canon@1` (`contract/canonicalization.schema.json`, implemented in
`munarium-matrix-core/src/canon.rs`) is the normative rule, and a test asserts
the code and the schema agree.

**2. A result that cannot name its rows cannot be sealed.** A contract declares
key columns or a total `orderBy`. Under keys the result hashes as a multiset, so
row order is irrelevant; under position it hashes as a sequence and needs a
total ordering. Declaring neither is a refusal, at apply time.

**3. Refuse before degrade.** Every failure is a typed [`Refusal`] with a
closed `class` the server switches on and an open `code` an operator reads.
There is no "best effort" path: a truncated result is marked truncated and
cannot back a completeness claim; an ambiguous identity files a finding and
merges nothing; a schema change refuses until a human records a decision id.

**4. String concatenation is not an implementation.** A contract's SQL is
parsed, walked against an allowlist of declared tables, columns and
deterministic functions, and rewritten to positional placeholders. `SELECT *`,
subqueries, `now()`, and any non-`SELECT` statement are refused. A denied
column is refused in *every* clause, not just the projection.

**5. Evidence is regulated data.** Every artifact carries an authorization
equivalence class, and a session resolving a citation must **dominate** it —
at least the access level, and every compartment. Domination is a conjunction,
tested in both directions.

## The boundary

`matrix/` never depends on a `server/` crate and `server/` never depends on a
`matrix/` crate. The only shared thing is `contract/`, vendored into
`server/contract/matrix/` and drift-checked on both sides.

This is enforced, not asked for: `test.ps1` and CI both run a `cargo tree` grep
that fails if any server crate appears in the graph — which also catches "just
use the official Rust client", since that client path-depends on three of them
([questions.md] Q7).

`munarium-matrix-core` additionally depends on no runtime at all: no `sqlx`, no
`reqwest`, no `axum`, no `tokio`. That is what lets the evidence-identity rules
be tested exhaustively in milliseconds.

## Testing

Four tiers, in cost order.

| Tier | Where | Cost | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| offline | `./test.ps1` | $0 | every change |
| compose | `./test.ps1 -Postgres -BlackBox` | $0 | every change, and in CI |
| live | the ephemeral Azure estate | cents per cycle, **$0 idle** | phase exits, on demand |
| deployment smoke | the always-on dev server, opt-in | $0 marginal | Phase 3+ |

The live tier creates its estate, runs, and **destroys** it; a cycle that
leaves resources behind fails even when every scenario passed. The first
recorded cycle and the three defects it caught are in
`test-estate.md`.

## Environment

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_ROLE` | `control` \| `query` \| `sync` \| `reconcile` \| `all` |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_HTTP_ADDR` / `_OPS_ADDR` | listeners; default `0.0.0.0:8180` / `0.0.0.0:9190` |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_DATABASE_URL` | schema `matrix`, role `matrix_owner` |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_AUTH_MODE` | `static` (default) \| `disabled` |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_STATIC_TOKENS` | `token:tenant:role,...` where role is `rw` \| `ro` \| `mgmt` |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_SERVER_URL` | munarium-server base URL |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_SERVER_TOKEN_REF` | reference to the server token; resolved at call time |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_TARGET_SERVER_VERSION` | lockstep target; a **major** mismatch refuses to start |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_SECRET_<NAME>` | a `credentialRef` resolves here (also `env:` / `file:`) |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | per-role ceiling |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_EGRESS_DEFAULT_DENY` | default `true` |
| `MUNARIUM_MATRIX_LOG` / `_LOG_FORMAT` | filter; `plain` \| `json` |

Roles gate the surface **structurally**: a `sync` container answers 404 on the
registry because it does not mount those routes at all.

## Ports

REST 8180, ops 9190 — no clash with the server's 8080/50051/9090 or the demo
BFF on one laptop. The compose Postgres is on 5434 for the same reason.

## The lab arm

the research repository's `structured_sources` experiment
is Matrix's experiment (plan package L-0.1): the same traps, planted in SQLite,
driven through the lab's retrieval loop with a `matrix_fts` backend that
implements all three modes. It exists so the risky assumptions could be
falsified for **$0** before any of this crate tree depended on them, and it
found four real defects while being built.

The two implementations are independent, which is what makes agreement between
them evidence rather than coincidence. `canon@1`'s separators are mirrored
there from `munarium-matrix-core/src/value.rs` with a comment saying so: if
they drift, the experiment stops being evidence about Matrix, and that should
be noticed rather than discovered.
