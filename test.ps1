.SYNOPSIS
  The Matrix test runner. Four tiers, the same vocabulary the plan uses.

.DESCRIPTION
  Default (no switch) is the OFFLINE tier: workspace unit tests plus the
  boundary checks, no database, no network, $0. That is what runs on every
  save and what CI runs on every push.

    ./test.ps1                 offline: unit tests + boundary + contract checks
    ./test.ps1 -Postgres       + store and conformance tests against compose Postgres
    ./test.ps1 -BlackBox       + a compose-launched Matrix, conformance over HTTP
                               (incl. gRPC, MCP and the /admin console tier),
                               and the sqlserver engine tier (WP-6.8)
    ./test.ps1 -Gates          fmt + clippy -D warnings + the offline tier
    ./test.ps1 -All            everything the laptop can run

  The LIVE tier is not here: it runs on the ephemeral Azure estate through
  deploy/azure/test-cycle.ps1, because it costs money and must be destroyed
  afterwards.

  The HTTP tier needs a compose-launched SERVER too, because sealing evidence
  needs a peer and a role that seals cannot run without one. Two profiles
  provide it (phase 2 of the commercial repository plan, 2026-09-03): `server`
  pulls the pinned release image named in deploy/SERVER_IMAGE -- the only form
  a standalone Matrix checkout has -- and `server-source` builds THIS
  checkout's ../server, which is what matrix-server-contract.yml tests on a
  pull request:

    $env:MUNARIUM_MATRIX_COMPOSE_SERVER_URL = "http://munarium-server:8080"
    docker compose --profile server up -d               # the pinned release image
    docker compose --profile server-source up -d --build  # this branch's server (monorepo only)

  Engine tiers that compose CANNOT stand up are not here either, and they say
  so rather than passing quietly: mysql (`--profile mysql`), cube
  (`--profile cube`), snowflake and bigquery each need a variable set, and
  every scenario in an unset tier prints SKIPPED. Snowflake and BigQuery have
  no account at all — see docs/adapters/build-matrix.md, which records exactly
  what is proven about each adapter and what is not.
